# Active Context

## Active Goal
* ML async queue added to FastAPI chatbot backend.

## Current State
* Re-run build succeeded after resolving TypeScript issues (pdf-parse typings, explicit filter parameter type, and signup action return type alignment).
* Next.js development server running on `http://localhost:3000`.
* FastAPI chatbot backend running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
* Codebase successfully re-indexed using GitNexus (`2,503` nodes, `4,105` edges, `60` clusters, `103` flows).
* Scraper Celery worker and Redis broker setup in `./scraper/` using Docker Compose. Ready for execution.
- ✅ Replaced synchronous `ThreadPoolExecutor` with **Celery** workers.
- ✅ Moved sessions to **Redis** (survives restarts).
- ✅ Next.js API routes use job polling (`/api/job/[id]`).
- ✅ KIE logic migrated from Next.js to FastAPI (`/api/kie` Python extraction).
- 🚀 Architecture is now fully async, supporting multi-user uploads without blocking.

## Obstacles
* None. Everything builds, runs, and indexes smoothly.
